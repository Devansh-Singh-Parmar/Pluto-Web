# Setup the project locally

1. Fork this repository into your Github account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local system using `git clone -b beta https://github.com/USERNAME/Pluto.git` where `USERNAME` is your actual github username.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not use normal `git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/Pluto.git` since it will directly clone the main branch of your forked repository and while the main branch is the stable version of the web app and beta branch is actually the development branch and that is where all the new changes will be committed.

3. Navigate to `/server` directory which is the back-end of our web application, then run `npm install` (or) `yarn install` to install all dependencies.
4. Also install `Nodemon` using `npm install -g nodemon`
5. Create a file named `.env` in the `/server` directory itself, and paste the following into the file:

```
PORT=(The port number you want the backend to run in)
MONGO_URI=(The uri of the MongoDB database)
```

6. Replace the `PORT` environment variable with the port number you want the backend to run in, it is recommended to use the port number `4000` as it is the common port number used for back-end servers. For the `MONGO_URI` environment variable, you need to create an account on [MongoDB Website](https://www.mongodb.com/) and create a project, create a shared database _(the only free-tier database that MongoDB offers per project)_ and click connect button, click drivers and then choose the latest Node.js version and then copy the uri and paste it into the `MONGO_URI` environment variable.
7. At last, you can run `npm run dev` to run the back-end server with nodemon or `npm run start` to run the back-end server with node.
8. Now navigate to `/client` directory which is the front-end of our web application, then run `npm install` (or) `yarn install` to install all dependencies.
9. Finally, run `npm run dev` to run the front-end client application.

> [!WARNING]
> You need to run two instances in two different terminals, one is the front-end client and another one is the back-end server. If you run only client then the client won't display elements properly as the back-end server is offline.

_Congrats! You successfully setting up the project locally! Now you can start contributing! If you ran into any problems, feel free to open a new issue in Bug Report issue template!_ ðŸ¥³

# Guide to contributing to this project

1. You can always find issues tagged "good first issue", those issues can be suitable for the new contributors.
2. After finding an issue to work on, first off check if there is any assignees already.
3. Then read the description of the issue and almost every comment on the issue which could be helpful to work on.
4. Finally _(if there are any assignees already)_ ping/CC them in the issue comments to ask and discuss about their current progress and knowledge on the issue which will be extremely helpful for your work.
5. Checkout/Switch to the beta branch by running `git checkout -b beta` as the beta branch is the development version of the web app while main branch is the stable version of the web app.

> [!WARNING]
> If you committed your changes to the main branch then your changes will not be accepted!

6. Then add and commit your changes and push it to your forked repository using `git push https://github.com/USERNAME/Pluto.git beta` as USERNAME is your actual github username.

> [!WARNING]
> If you just use `git push https://github.com/USERNAME/Pluto.git` then it will push the changes to main branch which is prohibited and you should only push to beta branch.

7. After pushing the changes to your forked repository, create a pull request from your forked repository's beta branch to the main repository's beta branch and be sure to also mention the issue using `#` (i.e. `#15`) in the pull request's name itself.
8. Your pull request will automatically be reviewed and merged into the main repository _(if it didn't run into any problems or any poor implementation)_.
9. If you found any bug, then create a new issue in the Bug Report issue template and anyone who found that this issue can be fixed will get assigned to this issue and fix this issue or maybe you can also try fixing it by yourself if you think you can fix the issue by your own or with the help of others.

_Thank you for your contributions to this project, we appreciate it very much!_ ðŸ¥³
